Hi World!

My name is Lucas, I have a wife and a kid on the way, I just turned 18, and I need money, so I'm learning to code. 
I'm thinking about building websites as a side hustle, so if anyone knows someone looking for a website to be built, I am all ears!

Also, I am thinking of putting together a team, we're gonna build huge websites and split the money according to how much work you put in. Because screw socialism.
